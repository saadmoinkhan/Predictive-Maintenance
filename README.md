# Predictive-Maintenance
This project uses the power of machine learning for early detection of equipment failure or equipment condition in order to preemptively trigger a maintenance alert to avoid machine failure which could have lead to serious consequences.

</br> 

* In this project, we will be analyzing airplane engine data but this can be <b>applied to other machinery as well</b>. We will try to predict the remaining useful life of the aircraft engine.</br></br>

* In summary, the scenario employs simulated aircraft data from 21 sensors to anticipate when an aircraft engine would fail in the future, allowing for proactive maintenance planning.
